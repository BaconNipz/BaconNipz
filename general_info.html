        <h1>Information About The Various Factions</h1>
        <h2>Baron</h2>
        <p>The frontiers of the human realm were defended by landowners known as Barons. Some Barons were warlike and restless. As humankind spread over Elysium and became dominant, these barons tried to usurp their masters’ powers and waged war on their neighbors. The large, well-trained forces at their disposal made them formidable foes. They were soon in control of large parts of the human territories. However, not all humans were content with this. The sorcerers of Elysium gathered armies of their own and nonhuman warlords called out for vengeance. The Barons must once again subjugate Elysium.<p>
<p>The Baron has a wide variety of human troops and huge siege engines at his disposal. Knights are formidable units who can inflict additional damage by charging enemies in the initial phase of a battle. Heavy infantry units are strong, but move slowly. Fast cavalry units under the leadership of mounted commanders work as highly mobile forces.<p>
<p>The Baron knows how to keep his subjects in line and can cow peasants into obedience. All farms and villages under the Baron’s rule are required to send a levy of soldiers to the Baron each year. This muster consists of simple spearmen from farms and at least one knight from each village. Large towns and cities do not contribute soldiers. The Baron can also form local militias to defend villages and cities. The larger the settlement, the stronger the militia.</p>

        <h2>Necromancer</h2>
        <p>Necromancers are sorcerers who are adept at the dark art of Necromancy, the summoning and creation of the living dead. The Necromancer can raise the buried dead or those that have fallen in battle as undead troops to strengthen his army. This practice is forbidden by the gods and Necromancers who are foolish enough to disturb the dead will lose their sanity in the process. Only dead humanoids can be raised as undead and once they are destroyed, they cannot be raised a second time because by that time their bodies are too broken. <p>
		 <p>The other aspect of Necromancy is the harvest of hands. On stormy nights, darkly robed men collect the left hands of hanged murderers. These are called the Hands of Glory. The burnt flesh of such hands is pleasant to ghosts and evil spirits who can aid the Necromancer in his horrible art. However, the hands can be used in even worse ways. When enough Hands of Glory are burnt, spirits from the darkest realms can be called to instruct the Necromancer how to turn his body into that of a living dead. Some necromancers use the Hands of Glory to rend the veil between worlds to quickly travel through the Underworld. <p>
		 <p>The Necromancer has very weak troops at the start of the game. It is essential for him to quickly find a battlefield or a graveyard. The ritual of Dark Knowledge is important in this search. The animated dead are weak and they never heal wounds sustained in battle, which makes them unreliable in the long run. <p>
		 <p>Use the apprentice to animate undead. Otherwise you will go mad and lose the ability to take rational action. Summoned undead require Hands of Glory, which can be found in villages, towns, cities and gallows. The ultimate goal of most necromancers is to transform into a powerful undead creature and live forever! Transforming into a lich will make you immune to insanity and vampires can cure insanity by eating villages.</p>
		
		  <h2>Demonologist</h2>
        <p>The Demonologist is a mage-priest who summons the denizens of the Abyss and the Inferno. The spirits of these realms are powerful and horrible to behold. They crave human flesh and can only be bound to service if they are sated. The greatest of these demons are insatiable and cannot be bound unless the Demonologist is very lucky indeed and the sacrifice is enormous. If the Demonologist fails the binding ritual, the demon will attack and try to devour the weakling human who had the temerity to attempt to rob it of its freedom. Some insane demonologists even try to open gates into the Infernal Realms. Should this happen, the end of the world is near.<p>
		   <p>The forces at the Demonologist’s disposal are truly powerful. Lesser demons are physically powerful and some of them have magical power the equal of any magic user. Greater demons are even more powerful and the mighty demon lords are practically unequaled in the scope of their magical abilities as well as in physical combat. Many demons use fire to damage their opponents and fire resistant troops in an enemy army may pose a problem for the unwary Demonologist.</p>
		
		  <h2>Witch</h2>
        <p>In the ages long before the arrival of man, beings of tremendous power roamed Elysium. These beings were the unchallenged lords of the as yet unnamed realm. In time they tired of exploring the land and melded into the earth to sleep. They slumbered for ages and other beings came to the realm. The sounds and laughter of these new inhabitants disturbed the Sleeping Ones and sometimes one of them woke to punish the newcomers. As a result, the Sleeping Ones came to be feared and worshiped by the people of Elysium. The adherents of this old faith are called Witches and are feared by troll and man alike. <p>
 <p>Witches collect fungi from the marshes and forests of Elysium and use them to brew a decoction pleasant to the Old Ones. The smell of the cauldron makes them hungry and reminds their slow minds of the Time Before, when all was quiet and the land was theirs. In rage and hunger the Old Ones and their servants follow the Witch to reclaim their lands from the noisy, shortlived interlopers. <p>
 <p>The beings at the Witch’s disposal are physically strong and easy to obtain, but most lack ranged attacks. Archers are a crucial supplement. The Witch’s ability to collect fungi from forests and swamps provides her with excellent scouting capabilities. The more fungi she uses for summoning monsters, the greater the chance of controlling the summoned creature. It is prudent to use plenty of fungi when summoning an Old One, for they are very dangerous if angered.</p>
		
		  <h2>High Priestess</h2>
        <p>Long ago in the land of Terra the god Ba’al was incarnated into a physical form and made humans taste fear and destruction. The moon turned red as blood and severe heat, drought and famine struck. Giants walked the earth and feasted on the flesh of humans. To placate this horrifying god, men began to sacrifice their fellow men in rites of blood. This pleased the Dark God, who consumed the souls of the sacrificial victims. Ba’al withdrew back into the world from whence he came and feasted upon slaughtered souls. But the giants remained. Ever since, mortals have worshiped the abominable God and sacrificed their own kind to him. From time to time Ba’al has even honored the prayers and sacrifices of his devotees by his very presence. <p>
 <p>When the Voice of El came to Terra and called out to the poor and the famished, Ba’al sent his subjects to war against him. The Children of El were hunted down and exterminated and fled to the promised land of Elysium. Ba’al’s interest and hunger was aroused and a High Priestess was sent to hunt down and eradicate the heretics until the entire land of Elysium kneels before the glory of Ba’al Revealed and spills the blood of men in devotion. <p>
 <p>The High Priestess of Ba’al performs ritual sacrifices in order to please her God and be rewarded by his favor. The giants and servants of Ba’al, whose service she can receive in return for a large sacrifice, can be nearly as powerful as demons and need not be controlled, for they are loyal to their Dark God even if it means serving a mere mortal. This makes the High Priestess a very powerful and reliable contender for the throne of Elysium. The greatest ritual the High Priestess can perform is to sacrifice her own body so that Ba’al can use it to enter Elysium in all his terrible splendor.</p>
